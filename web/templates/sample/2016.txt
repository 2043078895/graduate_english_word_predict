France,which prides itself as the global innovator of fashion , has decided its fashion industry has lost an absolute right to define physical beauty for women. Its lawmakers gave preliminary approval last week to a law that would make it a crime to employ ultra-thin models on runways . The parliament also agreed to ban websites that ¡°incite excessive thinness¡± by promoting extreme dieting.
Such measures have a couple of uplifting motives. They suggest beauty should not be defined by looks that end up impinging on health. That¡¯s a start And the ban on ultra-thin models seems to go beyond protecting models from starving themselves to death ¨Cas some have done. It tells the fashion industry that it must take responsibility for the signal it sends women , especially teenage girls, about the social tape-measure they must use to determine their individual worth.
The bans ,if fully enforced, would suggest to women (and many men) that they should not let others be arbiters of their beauty. And perhaps faintly, they hint that people should look to intangible qualities like character and intellect rather than dieting their way to size zero or wasp-waist physiques.
The French measures, however, rely too much on severe punishment to change a culture that still regards beauty as skin-deep-and bone-showing. Under the law, using a fashion model that does not meet a govemment-defined index of body mass could result in a $85,000 fine and six months in prison.
The fashion industry knows it has an inherent problem in focusing on material adornment and idealized body types. In Denmark, the United States, and a few other countries, it is trying to set voluntary standards for models and fashion images that rely more on peer pressure for enforcement.
In contrast to France¡¯s actions, Denmark¡¯s fashion industry agreed last month on rules and sanctions regarding the age, health, and other characteristics of models. The newly revised Danish Fashion Ethical Charter clearly states:¡±We aware of and take responsibility for the impact the ideals, especially on young people¡±. The charter¡¯s main tool of enforcement is (CFW), which is run by the Danish

For the first time in history more people live in towns than in the country, In Britain this has had a curious result. While polls show Britons rate¡±the countryside¡±alongside the royal family,Shakespeare and the National Health Serivce (NHS) at what makes them proudest of their country,this has limited political support.
A century ago Octavia Hill Launched the national trust not to rescue stylish houses but to save ¡°the beauty of natural places for everyone forever¡± It was specifically to provide city dwellers with space for leisure where they could experience¡°a refreshing air .¡±Hill is pressure later led to creation of national parks and green belts. They don¡¯t make countryside any more,and every year concrete consumes more of it . it needs constant guardianship.
At the next election none of the big parties seem likely to endorse this sentiment. The conservatives planning reform explicitly gives rural development priority over conservation,even authorsing ¡°off-plan¡±building where local people might object. The concept of sustainable development has been defined as profitable. Labour likewise wants to discontinue local planning where councils oppose development. The liberal democrats are silent. Only ukip, sensing its chance,has sided with those pleading for a more considered approach to using green land.its Campaign to protect rural England struck terror into many local conservative parties.
The sensible place to build new houses,factories and offices is where people are,in cities and towns where infrastructure is in place. The London agents stirling ackroyd recently identified enough sites for half a million houses in the London area alone,with no intrusion on green belt.what is true of London is even truer of the provinces.
The idea that¡±housing crisis ¡±equals ¡°concreted meadows¡± is pure lobby talk. The issue is not the need for more houses but,as always,where to put them. Under lobby pressure,George Osboyne favours rural new-build against urban renovation and renewal. He favours out-of-town,shopping sites against high streets . this is not a free market but a biased one. Rural town and villages have grown and will

There will eventurally come a day when The New York Times ceases to publish stories on newsprint .Exactlly when that day will be is a matter of debate.¡±Sometime in the future ¡±,the paper¡¯s publisher said back in 2010.
Nostalgia for ink on paper and the rustle of pages aside, there¡¯s plenty of incentive toditch print. The infrastructure required to make a physical newspaper¡ªprinting presses ,delivery trucks-isn¡¯t just expensive ;it¡¯s excessive at a time when online-only competitors don¡¯t have the same set of financial constraints.Readers are migrating away from print away .And though print ad sales still dwarf thire online and mobile counterparts,revenue from print is still declining.
Over way be high and circulation lower ,but rushing to eliminate its print edition would be a mistake ,say BuzzFeed CEO Joah Peretti.
Pereti says the Time should¡¯t waste time getting out of the print business,
But only if they go about it the right way .¡±Fighting out of a way to accelerate that transition would make sense of them,¡±he said,¡°but if you discontinue it¡°you¡¯re going to have your most loyal customers really upset with you.¡±
Sometimes,that¡¯s worth making a change anyway.Peretti gives the example seen as a blunder,¡±he said.¡°The move turned out to be foresighted.Ane if peretti would rale prices and make it into more of a legacy product.¡±
The most loyal customers would still get the product they favor,the idea goes,and they¡¯d feel like they were helping sustain the quality of something they believe in ,¡±So if you¡¯re overpaying for print,you could feel like you were helping,¡±Perettisaid ¡°Then increase it at a higher rate each year and essentially try to generate additional revenue.¡±In other words,if you¡¯re going to make a print product ,make it for the people who are already obsessed with it .which way be what the time is doing already .Getting the print edition seven days a week costs each ¨Ca year-more than twice as much as a digital-only subscription.

No matter how formal or informa the work environment,the way you present yourself has an impact. This is especially true in first impressions. According to research from Princeton University,people assess your competence,trustworthiness,and likeability in just a tenth of a second,solely based on the way you look.
The difference between today¡¯s workplace and the¡°dress for succeas¡± era is that the range of options is so much broader.Norms have evolved and fragmented
In some settings, red sneakers or dress T-shirts can convey status; in others not so much. Plus, whatever image we present is magnified by social-media services like LinkedIn. Chances are, your headshots are seen much more often now than a decade or two ago. Millennials,it seems, face the paradox of being the least formal generation yet the most conscious of style and personal branding. It can be confusing.
So how do we navigate this? How do we know when to invest in an upgrade? And what¡¯s the best way to pull off one that enhance our goals? Here are some tips;
41about how others perceive you.Maybe there¡¯s no need for an upgrade and that¡¯s OK.
42.Get clear on what impact you¡¯re hoping to have. Are you looking to refresh your image or pivot it? For one person, the goal may be to be taken more seriously and enhance their professional image. For another, it may be to be perceived as more approachable, or more modern and stylish. For someone moving from finance to advertising, maybe they want to look more ¡°SoHo.¡±(It¡¯s OK to use characterizations like that.)
43. Look at your work environment like an anthropologist. What are the norms of your environment? What converys status? Who are your most important audiences? How do the people you respect and look up to present themselves? The better you understand the cultural context, the more control you can have over your impact.
44. Enlist the support of professionals and share with them your goals and context. Hire a personal stylist, or use the free styling service of a store like J.Crew. Try a hair stylist instead of a barber. Work with a professional photographer instead of your spouse or friend. It¡¯s not as expensive as you might think.

Mental health is our birthright.(46) We don¡¯t have to learn how to be mentally heally; it is built into us in the same way that our bodies know how to heal a cut or mend a broken bone. Mental health can¡¯t be learned, only reawakened. It is like the immune system or the body, which under stress or through lack of nutrition or exercise can be weakened, but which never leaves us. When we don¡¯t understand the value of mental health and we don¡¯t know how to gain access to it, mental health will remain hidden from us.(47) Our mental health doesn¡¯t really go anywhere ;like the sun behind a cloud, it can be temporarily hidden from view, but it is fully capable of being restored in an instant.
Mental health is the seed that contains self-esteem-confidence in ourselves and an ability to trust in out common sense. It allows us to have perspective on our lives ¨C the ability to not take ourselves too seriously, to laugh at ourselves, to see the bigger picture, and to see that things will woke out. It¡¯s a form of innate or unlearned optimism. (48) Mental health allows us to view others with sympathy if they are having troubles. With kindness if they ate in pain .and with unconditional love no matter who they are. Mental health is the source of creativity for solving problems, resolving conflict, making our surroundings more beautiful. Managing our home life , or coming up with a creative business idea or invention to make our lives easier. It gives us patience for
